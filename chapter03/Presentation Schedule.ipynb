    "### Presentation Schedule and Assignment Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Paper Assignment**: Each student is randomly assigned a paper from a pre-selected list. The list comprises various academic papers, ensuring a diverse range of topics for presentation.\n",
    "2. **Presentation Timing**: The presentations are scheduled over a four-week period, with four students presenting each week. The specific date of presentation for each student is determined in advance and included in the 'Presentation Schedule'.\n",
    "3. **Schedule Adjustments**: Students who wish to change their assigned presentation date must coordinate changes privately. However, any changes to the schedule must be communicated to the instructor at least one week in advance of the originally scheduled presentation date.\n",
    "4. **Paper Changes**: If a student prefers not to present the randomly assigned paper, they may select an alternative paper. The alternative must be from a journal ranked SSCI or higher. Students must notify the instructor of this change at least one week before their scheduled presentation date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is essential that students adhere to the one-week notice requirement for any changes to ensure smooth coordination and adjustments to the schedule.\n",
    "- Students are encouraged to discuss any concerns or issues regarding their assignments with the instructor as soon as possible to allow adequate preparation time for all parties involved."
