    "The heart disease dataset is an amalgamation of five previously independent but well-known datasets, which are combined to create the largest dataset available for heart disease research to date. The five datasets included are Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and the Statlog (Heart) Data Set. This comprehensive dataset merges 11 common features across these sources, encompassing 1190 instances, facilitating advanced research on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) through machine learning and data mining approaches. The aim is to enhance clinical diagnosis and early treatment interventions.\n",

    "   - **Description**: This is a unique identifier for each question in the survey, facilitating tracking and analysis of responses to specific questions.\n",

    "   - **Description**: Represents the number of responses received for each course, indicating how many students from the sampled list actually provided feedback.\n",
    "3. **Total Configured**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: The total number of students enrolled in each course, providing a basis for calculating the response rate and assessing the representativeness of the feedback.\n",

    "5. **Weightage 1 to Weightage 5**:\n",

Each weightage captures different levels of satisfaction or agreement with the survey questions.\n",
    "6. **Average/Percentage**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: This field shows the weighted average of the responses for each question, both in absolute terms and as a percentage. This helps in quickly understanding the overall trend of responses for each question or course.\n",
    "7. **Course Name**:\n",

    "- **SN** can be used to align responses to specific questions and analyze data question-wise.\n",

    "- **Questions** are central to understanding the specific areas of faculty performance being evaluated.\n",
    "- **Weightage 1 to Weightage 5** allow for detailed sentiment analysis and satisfaction levels.\n",
    "- **Average/Percentage** offers a straightforward metric for gauging overall satisfaction or agreement with specific aspects of faculty performance.\n",
    "- **Course Name** and **Basic Course** enable demographic and longitudinal studies to discern patterns or differences in feedback based on year of study or academic discipline.\n",

    "   - **Hypothesis**: There is no significant difference in faculty performance between different courses.\n",

    "   - **Hypothesis**: Student satisfaction does not vary by year of study.\n",
    "   - **Test Type**: Chi-squared test for categorical data or ANOVA for numeric ratings.\n",
    "3. **Comparison between Graduation and Post-Graduation Streams**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: There is no difference in student satisfaction between graduation and post-graduation streams.\n",
    "   - **Test Type**: Two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (if data is not normally distributed).\n",
    "4. **Influence of Survey Response Rate on Satisfaction Scores**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Courses with higher response rates do not have significantly different satisfaction scores compared to courses with lower response rates.\n",
    "   - **Test Type**: Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis (to check correlation between response rate and satisfaction scores).\n",
    "5. **Impact of Course Size on Feedback Scores**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: The total strength of the batch (course size) does not affect the feedback scores.\n",
    "   - **Test Type**: Regression analysis or Pearson/Spearman correlation to check the relationship between course size and average feedback scores.\n",
    "6. **Uniformity in Responses across Different Questions**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Student responses are consistent across all 20 survey questions.\n",
    "   - **Test Type**: Friedman test (if the responses are ranked) or repeated measures ANOVA.\n",
    "7. **Comparison of Weighted Scores Across Academic Streams**\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: The distribution of weighted scores (from Weightage 1 to Weightage 5) is the same across different academic streams.\n",
