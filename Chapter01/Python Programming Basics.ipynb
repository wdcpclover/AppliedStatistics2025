    "This script demonstrates the importance of proper indentation, naming conventions, and the inclusion of comments to improve code readability. In Python, unlike many other programming languages that use braces `{}` to define blocks of code, indentation is used to define the groups of statements (blocks) that belong together. This approach not only makes Python unique but also contributes to its readability and clarity.\n",

    "1. **Use 4 spaces per indentation level.**\n",
    "   - Consistently using four spaces to indent helps in maintaining readability and clarity across various environments. PEP 8 specifically discourages the use of tabs because the perception of tabs can vary depending on the viewer's environment (e.g., some text editors might display a tab as 4 spaces, while others might display it as 8 spaces).\n",
    "2. **Part of a multi-line construct:**\n",
    "   - If your statements extend over multiple lines, you should align the wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets, and braces, or using a hanging indent.\n",
