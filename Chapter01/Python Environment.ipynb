    "# **Setting Up Your Python Environment with Anaconda and Jupyter**\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the fundamentals of Python programming, it's essential to establish a robust development environment. This section will guide you through installing Anaconda, a popular distribution that simplifies package management and deployment, and setting up Jupyter, an interactive notebook that facilitates code writing, debugging, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Step-by-Step Installation Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Anaconda**:\n",
    "   - Visit the official Anaconda website at Anaconda.com.\n",
    "   - Choose the version of Anaconda you need for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "   - Download the installer.\n",
    "2. **Install Anaconda**:\n",
    "   - Run the downloaded installer. Follow the on-screen instructions, ensuring that you check the box to \"Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable\" for easier access via command line.\n",
    "   - Complete the installation and verify it by opening your command line (cmd on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux) and typing `conda list`. You should see a list of installed packages.\n",
    "3. **Set Up Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Launch Anaconda Navigator, a graphical interface that lets you manage your environments and packages.\n",
    "   - Find Jupyter Notebook in the list of applications and click on it to launch.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, you can open a command line and type `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "4. **Create Your First Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Once Jupyter opens in your browser, click on “New” at the top right corner, and select \"Python 3\" to start a new notebook.\n",
    "   - A new notebook page will open where you can start typing your Python code.\n",
    "5. **Test Your Setup**:\n",
    "   - In the new Jupyter notebook, type the following code: `print(\"Hello, world!\")`\n",
    "   - Run the cell by pressing Shift + Enter. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the output \"Hello, world!\" below the code cell.\n",
